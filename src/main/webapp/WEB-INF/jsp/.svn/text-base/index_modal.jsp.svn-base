							It remained a separated product niche until a couple years ago when advanced business process management began including its capabilities in our product suites.
							<br><br>
							Our objective is to close the loop of continuous process improvement by providing business users with process monitoring tools. In spite of this addition, which greatly simplified its implementation, the level of its implementations has remained relatively low - primarily because of organizational politics, a lack of skills, or unavailable funding. We creatively generated the idea based on common best practices for companies planning to implemet it, such as creating center of excellence, involving middle management early and choosing the right metrics.

							We encompass all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products.

							The first requirement for an exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and elegance that produce products that are a joy to own, a joy to use. True user experience goes far beyond giving customers what they say they want, or providing checklist features. In order to achieve high-quality user experience in a company's offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple disciplines, including engineering, marketing, graphical and industrial design, and interface design.
