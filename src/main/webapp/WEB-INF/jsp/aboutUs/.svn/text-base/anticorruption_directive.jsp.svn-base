	                            Corruption is any abuse of a position of trust to gain an unfair advantage. It can occur at different levels and in various different forms. It focuses on bribery of (Indonesia or foreign) public officials; however, corruption between private individuals also poses a problem in business transactions and is a punishable offense. Initially the Brighten & Richness Technology employee involved in the corruption will face prosecution. Additionally, the company also faces criminal prosecution and a fine of up to IDR 10 billion, as well as damage to its reputation.

							                            Brighten & Richness Technology opposes all forms of corruption. Bribery is not tolerated in any form. Employees should be mindful of credibility and integrity in professional and personal negotiations and relationships.
